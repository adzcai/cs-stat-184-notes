\paragraph{Why study reinforcement learning?} Reinforcement learning is an exciting an active field of machine learning research. It has been used to solve a wide variety of problems, including robotics, game playing, and resource management. Reinforcement learning is also a powerful paradigm for studying animal and human behavior. In this book, we will focus on the problem of learning to make decisions in a sequential manner. This problem is a natural fit for many real-world problems, such as autonomous driving, robotics, and finance.


This book expects some knowledge of linear algebra and multivariable calculus. Students should be familiar with the following concepts:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Linear Algebra:} Vectors, matrices, matrix multiplication, matrix inversion, eigenvalues and eigenvectors, and the Gram-Schmidt process.
    \item \textbf{Multivariable Calculus:} Partial derivatives, gradient, directional derivative, and the chain rule.
\end{itemize}


\section{Notation}

We will use the following notation throughout the book:
