# Proofs {#sec-app-proofs}

## LQR proof {#sec-proof-lqr}

1. We'll compute $V_\hor^\star$ (at the end of the horizon) as our base case.
2. Then we'll work step-by-step backwards in time, using $V_{\hi+1}^\star$ to compute $Q_\hi^\star$, $\pi_{\hi}^\star$, and $V_\hi^\star$.

**Base case:**

At the final timestep,
there are no possible actions to take,
and so $V^\star_\hor(\st) = c(\st) = \st^\top Q \st$.
Thus $V_\hor^\star(\st) = \st^\top P_\hor \st + p_\hor$
where $P_\hor = Q$ and $p_\hor = 0$.

**Inductive hypothesis:**

We seek to show that the inductive step holds for both theorems:
If $V^\star_{\hi+1}(\st)$ is an upward-curved quadratic,
then $V^\star_\hi(\st)$ must also be an upward-curved quadratic,
and $\pi^\star_\hi(\st)$ must be linear.
We'll break this down into the following steps:

1. Show that $Q^\star_\hi(\st, \act)$ is an upward-curved quadratic (in both
$\st$ and $\act$).
2. Derive the optimal policy
$\pi^\star_\hi(\st) = \arg \min_\act Q^\star_\hi(\st, \act)$ and show
that it's linear.
3. Show that $V^\star_\hi(\st)$ is an upward-curved quadratic.

We first assume the inductive hypothesis that our theorems are true at
time $\hi+1$. That is,

$$
V^\star_{\hi+1}(\st) = \st^\top P_{\hi+1} \st + p_{\hi+1} \quad \forall \st \in \mathcal{S}.
$$

:::: {#lem-q-upward-quadratic}
#### $Q^\star_\hi(\st, \act)$ is an upward-curved quadratic

Let us decompose $Q^\star_\hi : \mathcal{S} \times \mathcal{A} \to \mathbb{R}$
into the immediate reward plus the expected cost-to-go:

$$
Q^\star_\hi(\st, \act) = c(\st, \act) + \E_{\st' \sim f(\st, \act, w_{\hi+1})} [V^\star_{\hi+1}(\st')].
$$

Recall $c(\st, \act) := \st^\top Q \st + \act^\top R \act$.
Let's consider the expectation over the next timestep.
The only randomness in the dynamics comes from the noise
$w_{\hi+1} \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2 I)$,
so we can expand the expectation as: 

$$
\begin{aligned}
            & \E_{\st'} [V^\star_{\hi+1}(\st')]                                                                                                         \\
    {} = {} & \E_{w_{\hi+1}} [V^\star_{\hi+1}(A \st + B \act + w_{\hi+1})]                                             &  & \text{definition of } f     \\
    {} = {} & \E_{w_{\hi+1}} [ (A \st + B \act + w_{\hi+1})^\top P_{\hi+1} (A \st + B \act + w_{\hi+1}) + p_{\hi+1} ]. &  & \text{inductive hypothesis}
\end{aligned}
$$

Summing and combining like terms, we get

$$
\begin{aligned}
    Q^\star_\hi(\st, \act) & = \st^\top Q \st + \act^\top R \act + \E_{w_{\hi+1}} [(A \st + B \act + w_{\hi+1})^\top P_{\hi+1} (A \st + B \act + w_{\hi+1}) + p_{\hi+1}] \\
                           & = \st^\top (Q + A^\top P_{\hi+1} A)\st + \act^\top (R + B^\top P_{\hi+1} B) \act + 2 \st^\top A^\top P_{\hi+1} B \act                       \\
                           & \qquad + \E_{w_{\hi+1}} [w_{\hi+1}^\top P_{\hi+1} w_{\hi+1}] + p_{\hi+1}.
\end{aligned}
$$

Note that the terms that are linear in $w_\hi$ have mean
zero and vanish. Now consider the remaining expectation over the noise.
By expanding out the product and using linearity of expectation, we can
write this out as 

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \E_{w_{\hi+1}} [w_{\hi+1}^\top P_{\hi+1} w_{\hi+1}] & = \sum_{i=1}^d \sum_{j=1}^d (P_{\hi+1})_{ij} \E_{w_{\hi+1}} [(w_{\hi+1})_i (w_{\hi+1})_j] \\
    & = \sigma^2 \mathrm{Tr}(P_{\hi + 1})
\end{aligned}
$$

::: {rem-quadratic-forms}
#### Quadratic forms

When solving *quadratic forms*, i.e. expressions of the form $x^\top A x$,
it's often helpful to consider the terms on the diagonal ($i = j$) separately from those off the diagonal.

In this case, the expectation of each diagonal term becomes

$$
(P_{\hi+1})_{ii} \E (w_{\hi+1})_i^2 = \sigma^2 (P_{\hi+1})_{ii}.
$$ {#eq-qf-mean-diagonal}

Off the diagonal, since the elements of $w_{\hi+1}$ are independent, the
expectation factors, and since each element has mean zero, the term
vanishes:

$$
(P_{\hi+1})_{ij} \E [(w_{\hi+1})_i] \E [(w_{\hi+1})_j] = 0.
$$ {#eq-qf-mean-off-diagonal}

Thus,
the only terms left are the ones on the diagonal,
so the sum of these can be expressed as the trace of $\sigma^2 P_{\hi+1}$:

$$
\E_{w_{\hi+1}} [w_{\hi+1}^\top P_{\hi+1} w_{\hi+1}] = \sigma^2 \mathrm{Tr}(P_{\hi+1}).
$$ {#eq-qf-mean-trace}
:::

Substituting this back into the expression for $Q^\star_\hi$, we have:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    Q^\star_\hi(\st, \act) & = \st^\top (Q + A^\top P_{\hi+1} A) \st + \act^\top (R + B^\top P_{\hi+1} B) \act
    + 2\st^\top A^\top P_{\hi+1} B \act                                                                        \\
                            & \qquad + \sigma^2 \mathrm{Tr}(P_{\hi+1}) + p_{\hi+1}.
\end{aligned}
$$ {#eq-lqr-q-opt}

As we hoped, this expression is quadratic in $\st$ and $\act$.
Furthermore,
we'd like to show that it also _curves upwards_
with respect to $\act$
so that its minimum with respect to $\act$ is well-defined.
We can do this by noting that the **Hessian matrix** of second derivatives is positive definite:

$$
\nabla_{\act \act} Q_\hi^\star(\st, \act) = R + B^\top P_{\hi+1} B
$$

Since $R$ is sym. p.d. (@def-lqr),
and $P_{\hi+1}$ is sym. p.d. (by the inductive hypothesis),
this sum must also be sym. p.d.,
and so $Q^\star_\hi$ is indeed an upward-curved quadratic with respect to $\act$.
(If this isn't clear, try proving it as an exercise.)
The proof of its upward curvature with respect to $\st$ is equivalent.
::::

::: {#lem-pi-linear}
#### $\pi^\star_\hi$ is linear

Since $Q^\star_\hi$ is an upward-curved quadratic,
finding its minimum over $\act$ is easy:
we simply set the gradient with respect to $\act$ equal to zero and solve for $\act$.
First, we calculate the gradient:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \nabla_\act Q^\star_\hi(\st, \act) & = \nabla_\act [ \act^\top (R + B^\top P_{\hi+1} B) \act + 2 \st^\top A^\top P_{\hi+1} B \act ] \\
                                       & = 2 (R + B^\top P_{\hi+1} B) \act + 2 (\st^\top A^\top P_{\hi+1} B)^\top
\end{aligned}
$$

Setting this to zero, we get 

$$
\begin{aligned}
    0                  & = (R + B^\top P_{\hi+1} B) \pi^\star_\hi(\st) + B^\top P_{\hi+1} A \st \nonumber \\
    \pi^\star_\hi(\st) & = (R + B^\top P_{\hi+1} B)^{-1} (-B^\top P_{\hi+1} A \st) \nonumber              \\
                       & = - K_\hi \st,
\end{aligned}
$$

where

$$
K_\hi = (R + B^\top P_{\hi+1} B)^{-1} B^\top P_{\hi+1} A.
$$ {#eq-k-pi}

Note that this optimal policy doesn't depend on the starting distribution $\mu_0$.
It's also fully **deterministic** and isn't affected by the noise terms
$w_0, \dots, w_{\hor-1}$.
::::

:::: {#lem-upward-curved}
#### The value function is an upward-curved quadratic

Using the identity $V^\star_\hi(\st) = Q^\star_\hi(\st, \pi^\star(\st))$, we have:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    V^\star_\hi(\st) & = Q^\star_\hi(\st, \pi^\star(\st))                                                                \\
                     & = \st^\top (Q + A^\top P_{\hi+1} A) \st + (-K_\hi \st)^\top (R + B^\top P_{\hi+1} B) (-K_\hi \st)
    + 2\st^\top A^\top P_{\hi+1} B (-K_\hi \st)                                                                          \\
                     & \qquad + \mathrm{Tr}(\sigma^2 P_{\hi+1}) + p_{\hi+1}
\end{aligned}
$$

Note that with respect to $\st$,
this is the sum of a quadratic term and a constant,
which is exactly what we were aiming for!
The scalar term is clearly

$$
p_\hi = \mathrm{Tr}(\sigma^2 P_{\hi+1}) + p_{\hi+1}.
$$ {#eq-lqr-proof-scalar}

We can simplify the quadratic term by substituting in $K_\hi$ from @eq-k-pi.
Notice that when we do this,
the $(R+B^\top P_{\hi+1} B)$ term in the expression is cancelled out by its inverse,
and the remaining terms combine to give the **Riccati equation**:

$$
P_\hi = Q + A^\top P_{\hi+1} A - A^\top P_{\hi+1} B (R + B^\top P_{\hi+1} B)^{-1} B^\top P_{\hi+1} A.
$$ {#eq-lqr-proof-riccati}

It remains to prove that $V^\star_\hi$ _curves upwards,_ that is, that $P_\hi$ is sym. p.d. We will use the following fact about **Schur complements:**

::: {#lem-lemma-schur}
#### Positive definiteness of Schur complements

Let

$$
D = \begin{pmatrix}
A & B \\
B^\top & C
\end{pmatrix}
$$ {#eq-def-schur-part}

be a symmetric $(m+n) \times (m+n)$ block matrix,
where $A \in \R^{m \times m}, B \in \R^{m \times n}, C \in \R^{n \times n}$.
The **Schur complement** of $A$ is denoted

$$
D/A = C - B^\top A^{-1} B.
$$ {#eq-def-schur}

Schur complements have various uses in linear algebra and numerical computation.

A useful fact for us is that
if $A$ is positive _definite,_
then $D$ is positive _semidefinite_
if and only if $D/A$ is positive _semidefinite_.
:::

Let $P$ denote $P_{\hi + 1}$ for brevity.
We already know $Q$ is sym. p.d.,
so it suffices to show that

$$
S = P - P B (R + B^\top P B)^{-1} B^\top P
$$ {#eq-def-schur-psd}

is p.s.d. (positive semidefinite),
since left- and right- multiplying by $A^\top$ and $A$ respectively
preserves p.s.d.
We note that $S$ is the Schur complement $D/(R + B^\top P B)$, where

$$
D = \begin{pmatrix}
R + B^\top P B & B^\top P \\
P B & P
\end{pmatrix}.
$$

Thus we must show that $D$ is p.s.d..
This can be seen by computing

$$
\begin{aligned}
\begin{pmatrix}
y^\top & z^\top
\end{pmatrix}
D
\begin{pmatrix}
y \\ z
\end{pmatrix}
&= y^\top R y + y^\top B^\top P B y + 2 y^\top B^\top P z + z^\top P z \\
&= y^\top R y + (By + z)^\top P (By + z) \\
&> 0.
\end{aligned}
$$

Since $R + B^\top P B$ is sym. p.d. and $D$ is p.s.d.,
then $S = D / (R + B^\top P B)$ must be p.s.d.,
and $P_\hi = Q + A S A^\top$ must be sym. p.d.
::::

Now we've shown that $V^\star_\hi(\st) = \st^\top P_\hi \st + p_\hi$,
where $P_\hi$ is sym. p.d.,
proving the inductive hypothesis and completing the proof of @thm-optimal-policy-lqr-linear and @thm-optimal-value-lqr-quadratic.
